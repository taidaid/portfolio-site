# Bryan's Portfolio Site

1. Welcome to my portfolio site. This was a labor of love made with React, React-Router, React-Bootstrap, React-Transition-Group, React-Textloop, and React-Responsive.
2. I wanted to try out React-Bootstrap, but in the end, I decided it will not be a library that I use in the future. Its built-in styling did not give me the freedom I wanted.
3. I had great success with CSS Transitions from React-Transition-Group and React-Router combining to make beautiful page transitions. It did take a little bit of extra legwork to make it look as good as it does now, particularly with the positioning of the elements as the enter and exit. I had to ensure that they filled the same position and overlapped exactly, for example.
