              I see programming as one of the most challenging and rewarding
              occupations. Through programming, I have the opportunity to
              stretch my mind by completing intricate designs and functions
              while simultaneously creating real value for people.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a professional, I am proud to have established and directed an
              effective and cost-efficient IT department, as well as educated
              hundreds of students. I live for the thrill of accomplishment, and
              I often find it in training for races, learning languages, and
              completing projects.

              Throughout my life, I have participated in countless athletic
              competitions in baseball, football, rowing, lacrosse, and running.
              In my pursuit of knowledge, I have achieved proficiency in
              Mandarin and French, and, hopefully soon, Dutch. I have learned
              many computer languages as well, including JavaScript, CSS, HTML,
              Java, Python, SQL, and more.

              I began programming in Java over 10 years ago as part of my degree
              in Management Information Systems and learned to build
              applications using the LAMP stack. After graduation, I utilized
              PowerShell and SQL for scripting and reporting as a part of my job
              duties. Since then I have become deeply familiar with the MERN
              stack, including React.js, Redux, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap,
              Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. You can see some of my

            <p>
              My journey to becoming an educator began with learning Mandarin
              Chinese. I have always loved studying languages and to achieve
              fluency in Mandarin, I attended one of the most prestigious
              Mandarin training insitutions in the world, the Mandarin Training
              Center at National Taiwan Normal University. While there, I began
              teaching English to Taiwanese children and found that I loved it!
              Since then, I have continued to teach while improving my
              development skills daily. Teaching provides a wonderful chance for
              me to interact with young minds and exchange ideas across
              generational and cultural gaps. It also helps me maintain my
              Mandarin skills.{" "}

            <p>
              After graduation, I directed the IT department for a healthcare
              management company, National Pain Care. It was an innovative
              company with hard-working, caring, and intelligent people. I
              learned a great deal from my colleagues about system design and
              administration, personnel and project management, and even radio,
              TV, and digital marketing. Perhaps the most valuable lesson was
              learning to tie IT operations to KPI so that functions reflect
              business value, not just ability, and are prioritized
              appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was charged with managing all marketing and IT projects and
              staff. I even functioned as an office manager for 4 locations and
              50 employees for over 6 months. With my promises fulfilled,
              targets reached, and the decline of the company, I found myself in
              an excellent position to pursue a lifelong dream, fluent Mandarin.

              While learning Mandarin in Taiwan, I had the opportunity to

              Japan, Singapore, and Malaysia while there. In total, I have
              visited more than 12 countries outside of Europe and 8 countries
