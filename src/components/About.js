      您好, 我是翁博展.

      My name is Bryan Windsor.

        <h3>Software Developer</h3>
        <p>
          I first became interested in IT when I was running a Call of Duty clan
          at the age of 15. As the clan leader, I had to setup and administer
          the server and website which introduced me to networking and HTML/CSS

        <h3>Polyglot</h3>
        <p>
          I first began learning languages when I was 12 years old and required
          to take introductory courses in French and Spanish. I quickly
          discovered that I had a knack for French. After 6 years of studying
          French, I branched out into Mandarin Chinese and loved it. I studied
          Chinese and French concurrently for 2 years in university before
          traveling to China for a summer homestay program. I achieved limited
          fluency during this program and tested out of all Mandarin courses
          offered at my school. Sadly, this led to a decline in my ability.
          After graduation and working in Healthcare IT for 3 years, I decided I
          must revive this talent of mine and again enrolled in an intensive
          Mandarin program, this time in Taiwan. After 4 years of study, travel,
          and work in Asia, my Mandarin reached a comfotable level of
          professional proficiency. I began a Chinese Language club in Utrecht,
          Netherlands in order to share my passion with others. I have studied
          Chinese, French, Dutch, German, and Spanish.

        <h3>Adventurer</h3>
        <p>
          I learned to ski at 6 years old and never looked back. I have been
          traveling, skiing, snowboarding, kitesurfing, wakeboarding, SCUBA
          diving, cliff diving, free climbing, hiking, racing, exploring, and
          loving every minute of it.

        <h3>Educator</h3>
        <p>
          During my time in Taiwan, I became an English teacher for
          Chinese-speaking students. Through my Mandarin, I am able to easily
          and efficiently explain complex concepts.

        <h3>Healthcare IT Operations Manager</h3>
        <p>
          After graduation from university, I had the opportunity to work as an
          IT Manager for 3 years in a healthcare management startup. In the
          beginning, the company had one outsourced IT support specialist for
          more than 50 employees and scattered, outdated, physical servers on
          tape backups. By the end, I was truly working as a CIO, overseeing an
          in-house team of 4 IT field technicians, a network engineer, and a
          sysadmin. By utilizing an MSP for level 2 and 3 tickets that were
          beyond our field techs' abilties, we effectively managed costs and
          quality-of-service. With a dedicated "firefighting" team, the
          sysadmin, network engineer, and myself were free to put our thoughts
          on projects first and accomplish amazing feats, even though we were
          "building the plane while flying".
